Can digital monkeys type out competent shakespeare?

This is actually just a string extractor whose output is piped through festival.

Dependencies: festival, PLT Racket

Compile/run monkeys-typing.rkt <number of strings to extract>

Example: racket monkeys-typing.rkt 28 (to possible generate a sonnet)
